# Metschnikowia pulcherrima phenotype prediction

This repository contains code associated with a machine-learning analysis
of phenotypic traits and genomic features in *Metschnikowia pulcherrima* strains.

## Project status
This repository is under active reorganization to improve
reproducibility and transparency of the analysis pipeline.

## Current scope
- Exploratory machine-learning analysis
- Phenotypic trait prediction
- Integration of genomic features (k-mer embeddings, gene annotation)

## Reproducibility
A fully reproducible pipeline (environment definition, execution scripts,
and documentation) is currently being implemented.
